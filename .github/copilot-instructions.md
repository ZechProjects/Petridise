# Petridise - Simulation Observation System

## Project Overview
Petridise is a React-based simulation observation system that uses:
- **React + Vite + TypeScript** for the frontend
- **Phaser.js** for the 2D simulation/terrarium engine
- **Vercel** for deployment and serverless API routes
- **Google Gemini API** for AI-powered simulation generation and evolution
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Architecture
- `/api` - Vercel serverless functions for Gemini API calls
- `/src/components` - React UI components
- `/src/game` - Phaser game scenes and entities
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions

## Key Features
1. World configuration (gravity, size, compounds)
2. AI-generated starting environments and organisms
3. Real-time Phaser simulation with creature movement
4. AI-powered evolution and event detection between runs
5. Dynamic background textures generated by Gemini

## Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `vercel dev` - Run with Vercel serverless functions locally

## Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key (required)
